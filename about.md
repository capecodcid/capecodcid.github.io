##Work
I am currently an engineer at Argo AI working on prediction problems for self-driving cars.  Prior to this, I was a machine learning post-doc at Disney Research Pittsburgh and a high school physics teacher.  I earned a Ph.D. in physics at Princeton University working under Iain Couzin on problems related to collective behavior.  My work incorporates tools and ideas from a variety of diverse fields---applied mathematics, machine learning, computer vision, behavioral economics, psychology, network theory, statistical physics, computational neuroscience, ecology, and animal behavior.

##Life
I grew up on Cape Cod and love the ocean in any month, at any temperature.  No ... the beach does not disappear in January and yes ... it does snow on the beach.  I have three younger siblings and we grew up playing sports and board games.  If you invent a game that involves strategy, efficient use of resources, or two teams and chasing some sort of ball, disc, puck, etc., I will play.

##Balance
Most importantly, I am married to smart, beautiful, amazing woman who plans her fall Saturdays around Notre Dame football games.
