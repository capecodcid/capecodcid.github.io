##Work
I am currently a physics graduate student at Princeton University, working under Iain Couzin on problems related to collective behavior.  Our work incorporates tools and ideas from a variety of diverse fields&mdash;applied mathmatics, machine learning, computer vision, behavioral economics, psychology, network theory, statistical physics, computational neuroscience, ecology, and animal behavior.  It is an incredible place to work with lots really smart (and fun) people.  To learn more about the lab and our work visit the [Couzin Lab website](http://icouzin.princeton.edu).

Upon graduating I will be the founding science teacher at [Blackstone Valley Prep](http://www.bvprep.blogspot.com/) (BVP) in Rhode Island:

* To become an excellent teacher
* To transform science education into something much more integrated and empirical
* To train a new generation that is more quantitative and scientifically literate than my own 

##Life
I grew up on Cape Cod and love the ocean in any month, at any temperature.  No ... the beach does not disappear in January and yes ... it does snow on the beach.  I have three younger siblings and we grew up playing sports and board games.  If you invent a game that involves strategy, efficient use of resources, or two teams and chasing some sort of ball, disc, puck, etc., I will play.

##Balance
Most importantly, I am married to smart, beautiful, amazing woman who plans her fall Saturdays around Notre Dame football games.
