This is simply a running list of other blogs/articles etc. that I am reading or consider to be exceptional in their clarity or usefulness.  They are broadly divided into categories and sub-categories for some organization.


## Education

Here we have all things education, from tools I am considering using in my own classroom to more general articles and commentaries.


## Technical

### Git

Joseph's [A Hackerâ€™s Guide to Git](http://wildlyinaccurate.com/a-hackers-guide-to-git) is a fantastic peak under the hood of git.


### Machine Learning

The world of machine learning is so full of jargon and nested concepts that it can often be difficult to figure out what to even google when trying to understand a new concept.  The interactive concept maps at [Metacademy](http://www.metacademy.org/graphs/concepts/deep_belief_networks#focus=deep_belief_networks&mode=explore) have been incredibly helpful.
