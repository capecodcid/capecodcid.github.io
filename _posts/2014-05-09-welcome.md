Welcome to _Plan Your Work---Work Your Plan_!  Please feel free to leave feedback or [reach out]({{site.url}}/contact) with new ideas!

Beginning this fall I am embarking on a new and ambitious adventure.  I will be the founding science teacher at a brand new [high school](http://www.blackstonevalleyprep.org) serving scholars from Pawtucket, Lincoln, Central Falls, and Cumberland Rhode Island.  My hope is that this blog will serve a variety of purposes:

* To chronicle my transition from research to education.
* To serve as an open lab-book for starting a new science program.
* To connect with other scientists and educators.
* To give me a place to continue to write about science.

The blog is named after the repeated adage of the best teacher I ever had.  Mr. Flynn was my high school Latin and AP English Lit; teacher.  He taught me how to write, and, as I prepare to teach, I find myself thinking through all of the lessons I learned from him.  The walls of his classroom were covered in the ancient wisdom of Plato and Cicero, but his most influential adage was simple: _plan your work_ then _work your plan_.  If my students walk away from my class with that ability I will be very proud.  Thank you Mr. Flynn.
