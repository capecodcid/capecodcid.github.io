As I role up my sleeves and get into the [NGSS](http://www.nextgenscience.org/next-generation-science-standards) (science standards) as well as the [Common Core](http://www.corestandards.org/read-the-standards/) (math and ELA), I have begun to think about how other teachers can help my scholars learn science.

Math is relatively straightforward and I can easily recommend physics problems for any high school math concept.  ELA, on the other hand, presents a more substantial challenge. There are dozens of incredible of PopSci books and scientist biographies I would recommend for 12th grade readers, but there is very little PopSci work for young adults (8th - 10th grade reading level).

So I am crowdsourcing a booklist here.  Any good recommendations for age appropriate PopSci?  Please leave suggestions in the comments.
