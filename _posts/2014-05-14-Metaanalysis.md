Our [last post]({% post_url 2014-05-13-Active_Learning_Paper %}) highlighted a recent metaanalysis of active instruction in STEM courses, which leads the question---_what is metaanalysis?_  For a semi-technical review of the topic see [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis).  This post will be much more general.

<div class="message">
	In essence, metaanalysis is nothing more than research about research.  It is used to describe studies that combine, compare, and summarize several existing studies.
</div>

In [yesterday's post]({% post_url 2014-05-13-Active_Learning_Paper %}), each of the data points in the figures we reprinted was the result of the aggregated results of other studies. (Image Credit: Freeman et al. PNAS.)

On the left there are the results of 31 different studies that our combined into a single data point in Freeman's metaanalysis on the right.  As you might imagine, much of the difficulty in doing such an analysis comes in finding a way to put all of the different studies on equal footing.  However, with the correct statistics there are several advantages to looking across studies:

* Provide more accurate and precise estimates of effect size.
* Identify inconsistent results in specific studies.
* Explore additional sources of variation in results.
* Investigate publication bias.

<em>**Caveat**---combining many bad studies doesn't magically give you a good meta-result.  Data/study quality is always important!  Also, metaanalysis is not immune to bias---researchers must still be careful and rigorous.

<div class="message">
	Publication bias is the tendency to report positive results and not null results.  Sometimes this can be because null results aren't as interesting and are often hard to publish, other times this is because scientists are people, and can convince themselves that a null result was due to a faulty experiment.

Meta-analysis has become an important part of medical research (particularly in identifying conflicts of interest), but perhaps the most public face of metaanalysis has been [Nate Silver](http://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nate-silver/).  In parallel with [Sam Wang](http://election.princeton.edu/about/), Mr. Silver applied this idea of metaanalysis to polling data (weighting each poll by its historical accuracy) and predicted the outcomes of both the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections with almost perfect accuracy.  You can read about this methodology [here](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/frequently-asked-questions-last-revised/) or [here](http://election.princeton.edu/faq/).  He also applied these same ideas to predicting the most probable [March Madness bracket](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/nate-silvers-ncaa-basketball-predictions/).

> The perfect bracket is astronomically unlikely.  Perhaps we will cover this in another post.
