I have been an assistant instructor for many different courses during my studies at Princeton.  There was one course, however, that really taught me a great deal about how to teach.  ISC (integrated science) is _hard_, really really hard.  I was an AI for the lab portion of the class and I was astounded with what the professors expected of their freshmen.  Not only did they have to be proficient with a wide range of experimental equipment---spanning physics, chemistry, and biology---they had to be able to do quantitative data analysis in MATLAB, and write journal style reports.  **The students delivered**.  They worked extremely hard, were held to the highest standards, and their work was incredible. They left ISC ready to join a lab and be a valuable researcher.

I carried this new realization of just how much you could expect from freshman to my other courses with similar results.  It was a lot of work for me as an instructor, because high standards requires more feedback---both more iterations of feedback and more depth.  The first time through you have to be willing to work with each student until their work is perfect, a process they can apply to later work.  Many of the freshmen I had in all different courses are now upperclassmen or have graduated.  Whenever I run into any of them, I get the same response---_your course was hard, but it really prepared me for x_.

One small piece of this was writing reports in LaTeX.  They look so much more like a real publication and students are subsequently more proud of their work.  They leave with something portfolio-worthy, which I think is really important. 



> For those unfamiliar with [LaTeX](latex-project.org), it is a system for high quality typesetting (particularly for scientific or technical reports).  Whenever you see a scientific journal article or even a text book, it was most likely prepared using LaTeX.  To typeset a document you write code which is then compiled into a document.  I will try to write a LaTeX primer in the future.


Getting students started using LaTeX is easier than ever today with a variety of in browser options.  Students no longer need to install the compiler or anything else.  They can simply go to a website and work on their projects.  In principle they can collaborate as well, although I have not tried this yet.

There seem to be three established options for LaTeX in the browser:

* [WriteLatex](https://www.writelatex.com/)
* [ShareLatex](https://www.sharelatex.com/)
* [Authorea](https://www.authorea.com/)

All three are free and fairly straight forward.  I have taken each for a brief test drive and so far my preference is for [ShareLatex](https://www.sharelatex.com/) as it most closely resembles the LaTeX environment I have on my own computer.  All of my own `.tex` files render correctly, even those require journal specific formatting (i.e. revtex).  Additionally, the compilation errors are very clear and helpful.  [ShareLatex](https://www.sharelatex.com/) also has a huge library of templates, allowing students to pick from dozens of journals, CVs, resumes, etc.

Authorea may be a good way to start new students, as it looks less like code and a bit more like a conventional word processor.

> I hope to do a full review of each one in the future.

I encourage you to try them out and leave comments with your favorite!
