Have you ever tried to take a picture of someone in front of a bright window?  You end up with a silhouette, a shadow in front of the window.  The picture has none of the details of their face that you can see with your own eyes.  As incredible as cameras have become, they still capture only a pale imitation of what we see with our own eyes.  There are ways more faithfully capture our visual world.  Stereoscopic (3-D) images and movies are in movie theaters everywhere.  In this post we are going to discuss dynamic range and the problem of our silhouette in front of the window.
